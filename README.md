# pancakes
A software platform for programming distributed robot and sensor node applications.

This software system leveraged actor-oriented programming to facilitate the development of distributed robot and sensor node applications.
I developed this software with [jdelacroix](http://github.com/jdelacroix) while pursuing my PhD at Georgia Tech. You can read about this software in our publication:
_Pancakes: A software framework for distributed robot and sensor network applications_ in _Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems_, 2013.

For grins, I am spending a little time revising the structure of the code and removing stuff that does not work. The goal is to have pancakes compile and run again using Player/Stage. Although both P/S and Pancakes are supplanted by the ROS gorilla, I find it useful to look back on these tools when developing new robotic systems with pub/sub architectures.
