A software platform for programming distributed robot and sensor node applications.

This software system leveraged actor-oriented programming to facilitate the development of distributed robot and sensor node applications.
I developed this software with [jdelacroix](http://github.com/jdelacroix) while pursuing my PhD at Georgia Tech. You can read about this software in our publication:
_Pancakes: A software framework for distributed robot and sensor network applications_ in _Distributed Autonomous Robotic Systems_, 2013.

**This code has not been tested in a long time! It is here for educational and archival purposes!**
